This is Gwm-2.1, the Generic Window Manager version 2.1.

There is a quickstart text in the doc/ subdirectory for you who cannot
wait to get started. Otherwise, there are general installation
instructions in the file INSTALL (in the top directory), and a manual
for Gwm-2.0 in the doc/ directory. There are also plenty of example
code in the subdirectories scm/ and scm/demo/, as well as an example
profile in "scm/gwmrc.scm.template" and "scm/menurc.scm.template". 

Please let me know about all problems, both building and running
and programming Gwm-2.1, and I will try to fix them.
