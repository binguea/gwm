This file is intended to give you the instructions required to get
quickly started with Gwm without having to read the manual or the
installation instructions.


* Compile and install:

Unpack the source and go into the directory "Gwm-2.0". 

Then you have to run configure:
  ./configure
or if you want to install in some non-standard place (in your own home
directory for exmple, if you have no root privilegues):
  ./configure --prefix=WHERE_TO_INSTALL

Then compile the code:
  make 

And finally install it:
  make install
(Unless you install in your own home directory, you need to be root to
install Gwm.)
  

* Start Gwm

The recommended way to start Gwm is from your ".xinitrc" or ".xsession"
file. At the end of that file, add either:
  gwm;
or
  xterm -e gwm;
In the latter case you will get a window with a "gwm>" prompt where
you can give scheme commands directly to Gwm. This is very useful if
you want to modify things while running Gwm, or test new things, or
understand why something goes wrong in Gwm.

Log out and in again to make the change to ".xinitrc" or ".xsession"
above take effekt. Hopefully Gwm will then start. 


* Configure your profile

The first time you start gwm, you will get a startup dialogue where
you can specify what type of windows, what menus, what focus mode,
etc, to use. Do this and then press OK. 

Further configuration can be done via Root menu -> Customize, or in
"gwmrc.scm" or in "menurc.scm".

If you want to try another configuration from the startup dialogue,
remove "gwmrc.scm" and "menurc.scm" and restart Gwm (Root menu ->
Restart).


* End Gwm

To end Gwm, you can either use the root menu:
  Root menu -> Quit
or give a command in the "gwm" terminal window:
  (end)

If gwm was the last command in ".xinitrc" or ".xsession", you will
then be logged out.


We thank you for selecting Gwm-2.0, and wish you a pleasant time in
front of your computer!
